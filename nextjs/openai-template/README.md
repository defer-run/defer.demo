4. Finally, go to the [Defer Vercel Integration page](https://vercel.com/integrations/defer) (_Click "Add Integration"_) to connect your Vercel application with your Defer ones.

5. You are go to go! The tasks will now run on Defer, triggered from your Vercel demo application ðŸš€

## Clone and run locally

1. Create a Next.js app using this template with the `npx command`:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/defer-run/defer.demo/tree/master/nextjs/openai-template
   ```

2. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd name-of-new-app
   ```

3. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The demo application should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
